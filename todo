# TODO

- or= and=

- move stuff out of format that should be in types

- a do block for making a quick anon func and calling it

- error with stray comma at end of line
- ugly error if attempting to assign to rvalue like #hello

- dump node in mark, see why values are being parsed multiple times

if hello else world
 ->  if hello then hello else world

- varargs that get put in a nested generated function aren't valid anymore:

- class expressions, x = class extends Hello do new: => print "hello"

* multiline comments
* table slices (almost)
* add continue keyword (ouch)

* combine for and if line decorators

* elseif with value that inserts lines
  - need to decompose elif into if inside else

* export could also be used like so:

	export a = -> "hello"

or

	x = 232
	export x


* allow return anywhere in block
* upercase constants and capital letter variables should automatically be exported (in the global scope?)

* any/every keywords for comprehensions? (what about iterators)

not working right:

    double_args = (...) ->
      [x * 2 for x in *{...}]


still some issues with whitespace at end of line

* let array items in table be defined without {} when indented
* key,value table comprehensions with { }
